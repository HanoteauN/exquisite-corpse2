The parties of adventurers were camping outside the newly discovered underground tomb which was discovered recently.
They were all happy because the pay that they will receive is a lot higher than normal plus there was most likely 
the firsts to go in this underground tomb called Nazarick.

Before going in the tomb, they call Lara Croft to have some helps. Because the place is haunted.
